# 50-50Challenge

50 days 50 projects challenge inspired by repo of [Brad Traversy](https://github.com/bradtraversy). Projects are made with HTML/CSS/JS. Although there are ready applications on brads repo, I watched result of his ideas and coded them only by myself.

# Background

I encountered GitHub repository ([Repo](https://github.com/bradtraversy)) of user [Brad Traversy](https://github.com/bradtraversy). Becouse practice is the best way to become an expert I accepted the challenge! I think that each effect is eye-pleasing and may be used in future websites.

# Technologies
I used:
- HTML
- CSS
- Vanilla JavaScript

Sometimes you may see references to Font Awesome.

# How to run

Repository is divided into days. Each day represents different project/effect on the website. Projects are made only for browser and all sources/assets are added to the repository. If you want to see the result just open file index.html of selected project.
